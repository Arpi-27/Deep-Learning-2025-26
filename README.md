# Deep-Learning-2025-26
This repository contains my Deep Learning projects and lab work developed as part of my B.Tech (2nd Year) specialization in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.
The projects demonstrate my understanding of neural networks, model training, evaluation, and real-world AI applications using Python and popular deep learning frameworks.
Objectives

To document and organize my deep learning lab work and projects

To gain hands-on experience with neural networks and deep learning models

To understand end-to-end model development: data preprocessing → training → evaluation

To build a strong foundation for AI/ML research and industry applications.
